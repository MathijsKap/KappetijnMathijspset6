Aspect: names

All names in the program use a consistent vocabulary

Example: 

Every file

Next time:

Use the same consistency as this time.



Aspect: headers

Headers are missing.

Example: 

Logon.java

Next time:

When creating a file copy the header from the previous created file and adjust this to the new file.




Aspect: comments

The comments are short, but they explain the code well. Sometimes you can add more comments inside a longer method.

Example: 

nextListener method

SelectTrivia.java

Next time:

Use a little more comments in methods.




Aspect: layout

Looking good! Maybe sort method and classes within a class

Example: 

SelectTrivia.java

Next time:

Check your code one time after cleaning everything.

Aspect: formatting

Formatting looks good and consistent.

Example: 

Every file

Next time:

Use the same formatting as this time.




Aspect: flow

Looks good!

Example:

Every file

Next time:

Use the same flow as this time.




Aspect: idiom

Looks good.

Example:

Every file

Next time:

Use the same idiom as this time.




Aspect: expressions

Looks good.

Example:

Every file

Next time:

Use the same expressions as this time.



Aspect: decomposition

Looking mostly good, but there are some long functions, which can be taken apart.

Example:

collectTopScores method

Logon.java

Next time:

Try to break very long functions apart.




Aspect: modularization

This is looking good. Every file has its own function.

Example:

Every file

Next time:

Keep it up!
